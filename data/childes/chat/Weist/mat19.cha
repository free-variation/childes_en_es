*MOT:	he's up on the stool ?
*CHI:	I just have_to be up here for a minute .
*MOT:	you just have_to go up there for a minute .
*CHI:	just to jump .
*MOT:	just to jump (.) oh my !
*CHI:	how I gonna get back in ?
*MOT:	how you gonna get back in ?
*MOT:	I don't know climb ?
*CHI:	there's my stool .

*MOT:	okay go ahead I'll move .
*MOT:	look what happened .

*MOT:	what happened to your stool ?
*CHI:	it's okay .
*MOT:	I don't know .
*MOT:	what happened to it ?
*CHI:	it just broke a little bit .
*MOT:	it just broke a little bit .
*MOT:	you better be careful .
*MOT:	we don't want you to get cut on it .
*CHI:	why ?
*MOT:	I wonder why ?
*MOT:	we don't want you to get hurt on it .
*MOT:	really don't step on it anymore .
*MOT:	you could probably sit on it .
*CHI:	why just gonna sit on it ?
*MOT:	(be)cause if you step on it again you could get your foot caught in there .
*MOT:	see (.) check it out (.) this could poke you .
*MOT:	I think we might actually have_to throw it out now .
*MOT:	where's your other stool didn't you have two stools ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*MOT:	where's the other one ?
*CHI:	this one is right here .
*MOT:	this one what ?
*CHI:	that one right there .
*MOT:	that one is right there yeah .
*MOT:	you can use it to dig right ?
*CHI:	maybe we could take this down and put this one up .
*MOT:	oh okay so we could take this one down and put this one up ?
*MOT:	that's a great idea .
*MOT:	here you go .
*MOT:	excellent idea Boo (.) (be)cause now this part is not broken .
*MOT:	we can just throw this part out right ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*MOT:	yeah .
*MOT:	great idea .
*MOT:	so now you have a stool again but (.) don't step on it again .
*CHI:	I just stand on it .
*MOT:	you just stand on it (.) that's what broke it before didn't it ?
*CHI:	I was just gonna stand on it then (.) I'm gonna [: going to] back up there to that one .
*MOT:	so you're gonna just stand on it go that way and then come that way ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*MOT:	but aren't you worried that it's gonna break again ?
*MOT:	hey hey (.) I don't want him to die honey .
*CHI:	why don't ?
*MOT:	because he's a cute little grasshopper .
*MOT:	you don't have_to mush him .
*MOT:	there you go (.) he's fine now .
*MOT:	he's gonna live in the grass now .
*CHI:	why he is ?
*MOT:	why he is ?
*MOT:	(be)cause he wants to live in the grass .
*MOT:	he probably doesn't really want to live in the sandbox anyway .
*MOT:	now don't jump off of it .
*MOT:	you can stand on it I guess .
*MOT:	I think that when you jumped off of it is when it had enough pressure on it to break .
*MOT:	so tomorrow we're going to do two very special things .
*MOT:	do you remember what they are ?
*CHI:	what ?
*MOT:	well one thing is (.) in the morning when you wake up (.) where are you gonna be now instead of a twinkle star ?

*MOT:	it is going right now .
*CHI:	why's just recording ?
